=Sql Performance Tips=
This are a few performance tips you should have in mind

== In dinamic queries use only the joins you need ==
Often I have seen code for reports or paginated pages where they do all the joins from the beginning and dinamically add the where conditions, inspite of the joins are only needed for some of the optional where conditions

Don't use select *
Aways specify the fields you need, tables evolve over time and what initially had 10 fields in the future could grow to 30 , plus more joins could be added to the querie fetching thoses fields too

Use prepared statements
they are faster
good for stadistics
protect from sql injection

Split the query if is to heavy in two or more and join results
